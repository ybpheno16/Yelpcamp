I have created a CRUD application named "YelpCamp" where a user can authenticate  himself by login or a new user can create a profile by signup and then can add information about new campsites and their price and location. 

Other users can view the campground and also add a review and delete it.

The users can also see the reviews given by other users.

A campground can only be deleted and updated by its creator and no one else.

I have used MongoDB to store all  the information and to access them.

I have used HTML,CSS and Javascript to implement the frontend of the application.

 I have used Express JS and Node JS to implement the backend of the application.

To start the app type "npm start" in the terminal
